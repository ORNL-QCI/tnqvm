# TNQVM Tensor Network XACC Accelerator
These plugins for XACC provide an Accelerator implementation that leverages tensor network theory to simulate quantum circuits.

Installation
------------
With the XACC framework installed, run the following
```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. -DXACC_DIR=$HOME/.xacc (or wherever you installed XACC)
$ make install
```

TNQVM can be built with [ExaTN](https://github.com/ornl-qci/exatn) support, providing a tensor network processing backend that scales on Summit-like architectures. To enable this support, first follow the ExaTN [README](https://github.com/ORNL-QCI/exatn/blob/devel/README.md) to build and install ExaTN. Now configure TNQVM with CMake and build/install
```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. -DXACC_DIR=$HOME/.xacc -DEXATN_DIR=$HOME/.exatn
$ make install
```
To switch tensor processing backends use 
```
auto qpu = xacc::getAccelerator("tnqvm", {std::make_pair("tnqvm-visitor", "exatn")});
```
or in Python
```
qpu = xacc.getAccelerator('tnqvm', {'tnqvm-visitor':'exatn'})
```

MPI Execution
-------------
TNQVM's `exatn-mps` visitor can support multi-node execution via MPI. 

*Prerequisites*: ExaTN is built with MPI enabled, i.e., setting `MPI_LIB` and `MPI_ROOT_DIR` when configuring the ExaTN build.

To enable MPI in TNQVM, add `-DTNQVM_MPI_ENABLED=TRUE` to CMake along with other configuration variables.

A simulation executable which uses the `exatn-mps` visitor, e.g. via 
```
auto qpu = xacc::getAccelerator("tnqvm", { std::make_pair("tnqvm-visitor", "exatn-mps")});
```
can be executed with MPI using `mpiexec -np <number of processes> <executable>`.
